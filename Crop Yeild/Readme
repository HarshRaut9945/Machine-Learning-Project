📘 Project Overview

This project predicts the type of crop suitable for cultivation in a specific field based on environmental and soil parameters such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium levels, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall.

The goal is to help farmers and agricultural experts make data-driven decisions to optimize yield and resource utilization.
This is a multi-class classification problem where the model predicts one crop type from multiple possible crops.

🧾 Dataset

Source: Kaggle – Crop Recommendation Dataset

Description: Each record contains soil nutrients, weather conditions, and the corresponding recommended crop.

🔍 Project Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing

Checked for missing or duplicate values

Label-encoded the target variable (crop name)

Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized distributions of soil nutrients, temperature, and rainfall

Used heatmaps to check correlations between features

Compared average values of each parameter by crop type

3. Model Building

Implemented and compared several supervised ML algorithms:

Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

4. Model Evaluation

Used the following performance metrics:

Accuracy Score

Confusion Matrix

Classification Report
