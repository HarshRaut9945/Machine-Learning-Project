📘 Project Overview

This project aims to predict the type of forest cover (tree cover type) based on cartographic variables such as elevation, aspect, soil type, hillshade, and slope.
It is a multi-class classification problem, where the goal is to correctly classify each observation into one of the possible forest cover types.

This project demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow — from data preprocessing, feature encoding, and train-test splitting, to model training, evaluation, and optimization.

🧾 Dataset

Name: Forest Cover Type Dataset

Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository / Kaggle

Description: Each record represents a 30x30 meter area of forest in the Roosevelt National Forest, Colorado, USA.

🔍 Steps Followed
1. Data Preprocessing

Handled missing values (if any)

Removed duplicates and irrelevant features

Checked for data imbalance

Applied feature scaling (StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler)

Performed encoding for categorical features (One-Hot / Label Encoding)

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
